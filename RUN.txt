# Setting Up the Environment to Run the Code

To successfully run the provided code, follow these steps to set up your environment:

## 0. Unzip training data

## 1. Ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python (version 3.11.8 or later)

## 2. Install Required Python Packages

Install the necessary Python packages using pip/conda.
pandas
scikit-learn
torch
transformers
spacy
numpy


## 3. Download SpaCy Models

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m spacy download sl_core_news_trf

## 4. Set Up the Project Directory

Ensure your project directory is set up as follows:

├── hw6.py
├── train_data
├── test_data
├── test_df.csv (if using already calculated embeddings)
└── train_df.csv (if using already calculated embeddings)

## 5. Run the Script

-You can run script with:   
    python hw6.py train_data test_data

## Additional Notes

- **GPU Usage:** If you intend to use GPU acceleration with PyTorch, ensure you have CUDA installed and properly configured. 
- I used GPU and it has been only tested with GPU.
- Embeddings can take up to 2h to compute.
